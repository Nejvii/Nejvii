  <li>Travel - motorcycle tourism.</li>
    <p>
      I love motorcycles and everything related to it.
    Nothing gives you such a feeling of freedom as driving straight ahead.
    Whenever I can visit the world, I like to discover new interesting places and cultures.
    I combine these two passions with each other, I get on my motorbikes and go wherever the road takes me.

  <li>Photography</li>
    <p>
      Whenever time permits, I take pictures and then edit them - adding an artistic note.
     </p>

    <p>
      I really like to compose from classic rock to electronic music,and i play guitar too.
     </p>
  <li>Sport - skiing, sports walk, Forumła 1</li>
    <p>
      The older I get, the more I realize that sport plays a very important role in life.
    For about 2 years I have been trying to work very effectively with time, I train Muy Thai, ride a bike
    In the winter season, skis and snowboard.
    In addition, I am very interested in Formula 1, watch every season and my little dream is to see it live.

    <p>
      I am also interested in broadly understood markets from Forex to suply market and stock exchange speculation.

    I don't believe in technical analysis;) only intuition. So far it works.
